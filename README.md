# Music recommender system
## About the project
---
A content-based music recommendation system that is designed to suggest 5 similar songs based on the user's input selection. The system recommends songs by comparing genres and artist names, using saved similarity scores from the song metadata. This system is built using a combination of data preprocessing, vectorization, and cosine similarity scoring to generate personalized suggestions. The interface is developed using Streamlit, offering a smooth and interactive user experience
